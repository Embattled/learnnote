Programming Assignment 1

1. Introduction

PNM, consisting of PBM, PGM, and PPM, is a popular
image file format in image processing especially
on UNIX.  netpbm, a program suite for handling PNM
files, has been widely used.
In this series of assignments we use PNM as the
standard input/output file format.

The details about PBM, PGM, and PPM can be found at:
  http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/


2. Making easy programs

Let's make some easy programs in C/C++, preferably
on UNIX (including Linux and Solaris) but not limited
to.

xv is a popular image viewer on UNIX.
(If you are using Windows, IrfanView is very useful.)
First of all, create a PGM file using xv or find a PGM
file somewhere. Using binary format instead of ascii
format is preferable, since ascii format is obsolete
these days.

Should you try
  $ xv
you will find the usage is quite intuitive.


The first assignment is for making a program which does:

(1) read a PGM file (portable graymap) onto the memory
    (1 dimensional or 2 dimensional array), and print
    the width and height of the image on the screen,

(2) write the image data on the memory to a new PGM file.

For example, the command "easypgm" can be used in this
way:

  $ ./easypgm input.pgm output.pgm
  Image size = 640x480
  $

If you try
  $ xv output.pgm
you should see exactly the same image as input.pgm .
If the images do not match, there's something wrong
with your program.

Since this is a training, you should not use any image
processing library such as OpenCV or libnetpbm.

Good luck!

Programming Assignment 2

1. Make a program which reads a PGM file, converts the
 image into an RGB image, and produces a PPM file,
 just like pgmtoppm in the netpbm does.

  example:
  $ ./mypgmtoppm input.pgm > output.ppm

Hint:
 Let R=Gr, G=Gr, and B=Gr, where Gr is the gray value
 of PGM image.


2. Make a program which reads a PGM file, converts the
 image into a bitmap image, and produces a PBM file,
 just like "pgmtopbm -threshold -value val" in the
 netpbm does.

  example:
  $ ./mypgmtopbm thres input.pgm > output.pbm
  where thres is a threshold value between 0 and 255.

Hints:
 Let pixel value be 1 if the gray value is smaller than
 the given threshold.
 Otherwise, let pixel value be 0.

 This program requires some bit operations such as
 logical and/or (& and | in C).

Programming Assignment 3

1. Make a program which reads a PGM file, flips the
 image vertically, and produces a new PGM file.
 You should have a new image whose bottom and top lines
 correspond to the original image's top and bottom lines,
 respectively.

 Note that the new image is NOT the upside-down version
 of the original.

  example:
  $ ./mypgmflipV input.pgm output.pgm

Hint:
 Use a 2-dimensional array for storing the image.


2. Modify the program above and make another program
 that can handle PPM file. Then, create a program
 which reads a PPM file, flips the image horizontally,
 and produces a new PPM file.
 You should have a new image whose leftmost and rightmost
 lines correspond to the original image's rightmost and
 leftmost lines, respectively.

  example:
  $ ./myppmflipH input.ppm output.ppm

Hint:
 You do not need a 2-dimensional array for this program.
 A line buffer, i.e. 1-dimensional array, is enough.

Programming Assignment 4

1. Make a program which reads a PGM file, shrinks or enlarges
 the image by a scale factor given as a command line argument,
 and writes the image to a new PGM file.
 (A nice example is pnmscale.)

  examples:
  $ ./mypgmscale 0.3 input.pgm output.pgm
  (You will get a new image whose size is 30% of the original.)

  $ ./mypgmscale 1.2 input.pgm output.pgm
  (You will get a new image 20% larger than the original.)

Hint:
 Try "nearest neighbor method (最近傍法)" at first.


2. Modify the program above and make another program
 that is equipped with "bilinear interpolation
 (バイリニア補間)".
 Compare the output images with and without the interpolation
 to see the image quality differences.

Programming Assignment 5

1. Make a program which reads a PGM file, rotates the image
 by an angle given as a command line argument, and writes
 the image to a new PGM file.
 (A nice example is pnmrotate.)

  examples:
  $ ./mypgmrotate 30 input.pgm output.pgm
  (You will get a new image 30deg rotated.)

Hint:
 The output image should be larger than the original
 depending on the rotation angle.
 You may ignore "antialiasing process".

Programming Assignment 6

1. Make a program which reads a PGM file, apply a simple
 smoothing, and writes the image to a new PGM file.

  examples:
  $ ./mypgmsmooth input.pgm output.pgm

 A simple smoothing operation is obtained by local averaging.
 Use a convolution mask of 3x3 matrix:
   1 1 1
   1 1 1
   1 1 1  /9

 The new pixel value f'(x,y) is obtained by:
   f'(x,y) = ( 1*f(x-1,y-1) + 1*f(x,y-1) + 1*f(x+1,y-1)
             + 1*f(x-1,y  ) + 1*f(x,y  ) + 1*f(x+1,y  )
             + 1*f(x-1,y+1) + 1*f(x,y+1) + 1*f(x+1,y+1)  ) /9
 where f(x,y) is the original pixel value at (x,y).

Hint:
Special processing is required for image borders (upper, lower,
left, and right).


2. Change the smoothing mask to
   1 1 1
   1 2 1
   1 1 1  /10

 Compare visually the image smoothness.

Programming Assignment 7

1. Learn Sobel Filter and implement it. Make a program
 which reads a PGM file, applies the Sobel edge detector
 and produces a PGM file showing edge intensity.

  examples:
  $ ./mysobel input.pgm output.pgm

 The edge intensity is defined by Eedge = sqrt(Ex*Ex + Ey*Ey),
 where Ex and Ey are horizontal and vertical edge components.

Hint:
You need to scale the edge intensity to avoid pixel value
overflow in the output image.


2. Implement Laplacian edge detector using 3x3 Laplacian
 defined by a mask:
  -1 -1 -1
  -1  8 -1
  -1 -1 -1

 Make a program which reads a PGM file, detects edges, and
 produces a PGM file showing absolute values of the edges.

Hint:
Same hint as in 1.

3. Compare visually the difference between Sobel and Laplacian
 edge detection results. What difference(s) have you found?
