# opencv python

* OpenCV now supports a multitude of algorithms related to Computer Vision and Machine Learning and is expanding day by day.  

* OpenCV-Python is the Python API for OpenCV, combining the best qualities of the OpenCV C++ API and the Python language.
* OpenCV-Python is a Python wrapper for the original OpenCV C++ implementation.

**Numpy**
* OpenCV-Python makes use of Numpy. And OpenCV-Python requires **only Numpy**.
* All the OpenCV array structures are converted to and from Numpy arrays. 
* This also makes it easier to integrate with other libraries that use Numpy.
  * such as **SciPy** and **Matplotlib**.
