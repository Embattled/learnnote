# Arm Architecture - Instruction Set Architectures(ISAs)

In computer science, an instruction set architecture (ISA) is a part of the abstract model of a computer, which generally defines how software controls the CPU
A device that executes instructions described by that ISA, such as a central processing unit (CPU), is called an implementation.
